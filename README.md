# Tensorflow-football-model-2
Script that uses the Tensorflow neural network to predict betting-odds in a football match using tensorflow. 
The script uses the team-ratings before every match from the FIFA videogame database. I collected the info from
the webpage but I have not uploaded it to Github. I don't really know if I am allowed to share it. The script should 
be executed in a Tensorflow environment (Firstenv). In a standard environment there might be issues when importing the 
Tensorflow library
